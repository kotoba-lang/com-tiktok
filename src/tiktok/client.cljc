(ns tiktok.client
  "TikTok Content Posting API — portable `.cljc`.

  I/O is injected (`:http-fn` / `:json-write` / `:json-read` / `:creds`), the
  same DI shape as `kotoba-lang/com-x` and `kotoba-lang/com-youtube`.

  ## Two source modes, and why both are here

  `PULL_FROM_URL` hands TikTok a URL and lets it fetch — one call, but the URL's
  domain must be verified with TikTok first, so it is not available to everyone.
  `FILE_UPLOAD` returns an upload URL and takes the bytes directly, which works
  without domain verification but is a three-step flow. Neither is a superset of
  the other, so a client that only implemented one would be unusable for half
  its callers.

  ## Init does not mean posted

  Both modes return a `publish_id` immediately and finish asynchronously. A
  caller that treats a successful init as a successful post will report
  publishes that never appeared. `publish-status` is how you find out, and
  `await-publish` sequences the polling with an injected `:sleep-fn`."
